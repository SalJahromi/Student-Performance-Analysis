First, we will load all necessary libraries.

```{r}
library("readxl")
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")

```

## Inputting The Data Set

To load in the file.
```{r}
dfStudentDat <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/blueb/OneDrive/Desktop/StudentGradeAnalysis/student_data.csv")
head(dfStudentDat, n =  5)
```
Confirming that a datframe is achieved.
```{r}
class(dfStudentDat)
```

Column information.

32 G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)
```


For this study, we will compare variables with the final scores, regardless of which school the student attended. 

```{r}
#Drop the first column, the school attended.
df_Data_1 <- dfStudentDat[-c(1)]
head(df_Data_1, n = 5)
```
```{r}
#number of rows -> number of students
nrow(df_Data_1) 
```


96% confidence interval estimation of the mean final grade (out of 20)

Checking conditions for t-test:
  - Sample is random 
  - Population standard deviation is unknown
  - sample size(n = 395) > 30
  
```{r}
#FinalGrade will only have column of final grade
FinalGrade <- df_Data_1$G3
#t. test
t.test(FinalGrade, conf.level = 0.96)

```


```{r}
hist(FinalGrade, ylab = "Number of Students", xlab = "Final Grade", main ="Final Mark (Out of 20)")

```

We are 96% confident that the mean final grade in this data set is between 9.94 and 10.89.

# Bivariate Analysis

### Question: Are the final marks between male and female students the same? 

Comparison between sex and final mark. 


```{r}
#obtaining the columns of sex and final mark(G3)
dfSexMark <- select(df_Data_1, sex, G3)
head(dfSexMark, n = 5)
```



F test done in 95% confidence interval (a = 0.05). 

𝝈1 is the standard deviation of the final mark of male students.
𝝈2 is the standard deviation of the final mark of female students.

H0: 𝝈1 = 𝝈2
H1: 𝝈1 ≠ 𝝈2

```{r}
df_maleGrade <- dfSexMark[dfSexMark$sex == "M",]
# df_maleGrade

df_femaleGrade <- dfSexMark[dfSexMark$sex == "F",]
# df_femaleGrade

#F test to check type of t-test.
var.test(df_femaleGrade$G3, df_maleGrade$G3)
```

p-value = 0.6989
a = 0.05

since p-value > a, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, a pooled t-test is to be used.




H0: The final mark of male students is the same as female students.
H1: The final mark of female students is not the same as male students

Pooled T test in 95% confidence interval (a = 0.05).
```{r}
#pooled t-test, var.equal set to 'TRUE'
t.test(df_femaleGrade$G3,df_maleGrade$G3, alternative = "two.sided" ,var.equal = TRUE)

```

According to the pooled t-test, the p-value is 0.03987, which is smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. 
Since p-value < a, we reject the null hypothesis.

Therefore, we conclude that the final grade between male students and female students is not the same and a difference exists.

### Question: Do students who live in urban areas score higher than students who live in rural areas?

```{r}
df_rural_FinalGrade <- select(df_Data_1, address, G3)
head(df_rural_FinalGrade, n = 5)
```




F test done in 95% confidence interval (a = 0.05). 

𝝈1 is the standard deviation of the final mark of students with urban address.
𝝈2 is the standard deviation of the final mark of studetns with rural address.

H0: 𝝈1 = 𝝈2
H1: 𝝈1 ≠ 𝝈2

```{r}
df_urbanGrade <- df_rural_FinalGrade[df_rural_FinalGrade$address == "U",]


df_ruralGrade <- df_rural_FinalGrade[df_rural_FinalGrade$address == "R",]

# #F test to check type of t-test.
var.test(df_urbanGrade$G3, df_ruralGrade$G3)
```


p-value = 0.886
a = 0.05

since p-value > a, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, a pooled t-test is to be used.
